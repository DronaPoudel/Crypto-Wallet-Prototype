- ✅ Address validation for all transactions
- ✅ Secure transaction signing
- ✅ DApp connection management

### User Interface
- ✅ Clean, modern dashboard
- ✅ Network selector with visual indicators
- ✅ Balance cards for each supported chain
- ✅ Transaction creation forms
- ✅ Connection status indicators
- ✅ DApp connection approval system

### Technical Implementation
- ✅ Ethers.js integration for blockchain interactions
- ✅ Web3-compatible transaction signing
- ✅ Network-specific RPC connections
- ✅ Error handling and validation
- ✅ Responsive design for all devices

## Supported Networks

| Network | Chain ID | Symbol | RPC Endpoint |
|---------|----------|--------|--------------|
| Ethereum | 1 | ETH | Alchemy Demo |
| Binance Smart Chain | 56 | BNB | BSC Dataseed |
| Polygon | 137 | MATIC | Polygon RPC |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+
- npm or yarn

### Installation
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Usage

### Creating a New Wallet
1. Click "Create New Wallet"
2. Securely save the generated mnemonic phrase
3. The wallet will automatically load with multi-chain support

### Importing an Existing Wallet
1. Click "Import Existing Wallet"
2. Enter your 12-word mnemonic phrase
3. Click "Import Wallet"

### Sending Transactions
1. Select the desired network from the header dropdown
2. Enter recipient address and amount
3. Click "Send Transaction"
4. Transaction will be broadcast to the selected network

### Managing DApp Connections
- View connected DApps in the connections panel
- Disconnect unwanted DApp connections
- Monitor permission levels for each connection

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation (Prototype Level)
- Private keys stored in browser memory
- Mnemonic phrases displayed in plain text
- Basic address validation
- Demonstration-level error handling

### Production Recommendations
- **Hardware Wallet Integration**: Use Ledger, Trezor, or similar
- **Key Encryption**: Implement AES encryption for private keys
- **Secure Storage**: Use browser's secure storage APIs
- **Multi-signature**: Implement multi-sig wallet support
- **Audit**: Complete security audit before production use

## Testing Scenarios

### Network Switching Tests
- [x] Switch between Ethereum, BSC, and Polygon
- [x] Verify balance updates per network
- [x] Confirm transaction history filters by network
- [x] Test error handling for network failures

### Transaction Tests
- [x] Send transactions on each supported network
- [x] Validate address format before sending
- [x] Handle insufficient balance errors
- [x] Test gas estimation and fee calculation

### DApp Connection Tests
- [x] Connect to mock DApps (Uniswap, OpenSea)
- [x] Test permission management
- [x] Verify connection state persistence
- [x] Test disconnection functionality

### Error Handling Tests
- [x] Invalid mnemonic phrase import
- [x] Network connection failures
- [x] Invalid transaction parameters
- [x] Insufficient gas/balance scenarios

## API Integration

### Blockchain Interactions
- **Balance Queries**: Direct RPC calls to network providers
- **Transaction Broadcasting**: Ethers.js transaction signing and sending
- **Network Status**: Connection health monitoring
- **Gas Estimation**: Dynamic fee calculation

### Future Enhancements
- [ ] Token balance support (ERC-20, BEP-20, etc.)
- [ ] NFT display and management
- [ ] DeFi protocol integrations
- [ ] Cross-chain bridge support
- [ ] Advanced security features (2FA, biometric auth)
- [ ] Mobile app version
- [ ] Hardware wallet integration

## Architecture

### Components
